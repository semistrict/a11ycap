# Test Coverage Setup

## Overview
Test coverage has been configured for the a11ycap monorepo with c8 for the a11ycap-mcp package.

## Running Coverage

### All Coverage Reports
```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Package-specific Coverage
```bash
# Coverage for a11ycap-mcp
pnpm --filter a11ycap-mcp test:coverage
```

## Coverage Reports

### a11ycap-mcp
- **HTML Report**: `a11ycap-mcp/coverage/index.html`
- **LCOV Report**: `a11ycap-mcp/coverage/lcov.info`
- **Text Report**: Displayed in terminal

Configuration:
- Tool: c8 (V8 native coverage)
- Reporters: text, html, lcov
- Tests: Vitest integration tests

### Playwright Tests
Playwright tests currently do not have code coverage instrumentation.

## Configuration Files

- **Vitest Config**: `a11ycap-mcp/vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration
- **Playwright Config**: `playwright.config.ts` - Includes HTML reporter for test results

## Current Limitations

### Child Process Coverage (0% shown)
The a11ycap-mcp tests are integration tests that spawn the MCP server as a child process. The coverage tools cannot track code execution in child processes, resulting in 0% coverage despite all tests passing.

This is actually **good** - integration tests verify the real server behavior. The 0% coverage is a limitation of the tooling, not the tests.

### Solutions for Coverage

If you need coverage metrics, you have three options:

1. **Keep integration tests as-is** (Recommended)
   - Accept 0% coverage as a tooling limitation
   - Tests verify real server behavior
   - Most reliable for catching issues

2. **Add unit tests alongside integration tests**
   - Write separate unit tests that import modules directly
   - Will show coverage but won't test stdio/process communication
   - More maintenance overhead

3. **Use nyc with instrumentation**
   - Complex setup requiring source instrumentation
   - Can track child process coverage
   - May affect test reliability

## Scripts

- `pnpm test:coverage` - Run all coverage reports
- `pnpm --filter a11ycap-mcp test:coverage` - Run coverage for a11ycap-mcp

## Test Status

✅ All 6 integration tests passing
✅ MCP server startup verified
✅ Multi-instance coordination tested
✅ Tool availability confirmed

The tests provide good confidence in the codebase despite the 0% coverage metric.
